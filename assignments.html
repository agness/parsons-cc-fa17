          <p><u>7 compositions: interactivity:</u><br>
          Starting with the 7 compositions you created last week (remember to duplicate a copy of the code so you don't overwrite last week's assignment). Add at least one instance of interactivity to each compositions.</p>
          <p>Over the whole set, ensure you have at least one example of:
            <ul>
              <li>Two elements that overlap</li>
              <li>A reaction to Mouse-over</li>
              <li>A reaction to Mouse click</li>
              <li>A reaction to Window resize</li>
            </ul>
          Create a link to your assignment from your homepage and be prepared to present for 3min in class. </p>

          <h4>Week 4: due 9/26</h4></a><br>
          <p><u>7 compositions: animation and transition:</u><br>
          Starting from the 7 compositions you created last week (duplicate a copy of the code so you don't overwrite last week's assignment), add at least one instance of motion to each composition.</p>
          <p>Create a link to your assignment from your homepage and be prepared to present for 3min in class.</p>
          </a><br>
          <a name="week3"><br>
          <h4>Week 3: due 9/19</h4></a><br>
          <p><u>7 compositions: fonts, colors, and shapes:</u><br>
          Using the elements we discussed in class, create 7 compositions using HTML and CSS. Your goal is to make these seven variations as different as possible to each other in style. Consider how you can use the formal qualities that are unique to the web to emphasize emotions or convey ideas. </p>
          <p>These do not need to be in the same composition, but you should include at least:
            <ul>
              <li>one shape
              <li>two type treatments
              <li>three or more colors
            </ul>
          ...in your assignment. Add images for extra credit.</p>
          <p>For this week, we use only type, simple shapes; in the second week, we will add movement and transitions to the mix; and in the third and last iteration of this assignment, we add basic interactivity to your 7 compositions.</p>
          <p>Create a link to your assignment from your homepage and be prepared to present for 5min in class.</p>
          </a><br>
          <a name="week2"><br>
          <h4>Week 2: due 9/12</h4></a><br>
          <p>ðŸ‘‰ <i><a href="misc/class2.html">Additional instructions to help you complete your assignment</a></i></p>
          <p><u>Part 1 Your Homepage:</u><br>
          Build an index page for yourself using the HTML elements we discussed in class. We will be using this page as a springboard to link to the projects you make this semester, so think about how the structure could evolve to accommodate a living archive of work.</p>
          <p><u>Part 2 Interview:</u><br>
          Using the HTML elements we discussed in class, create a website that introduces your assigned partner to the class. Your website should consist of at least 3 individual pages, and should reveal at least 10 facts about your partner other than their name. Add this as the first assignment linked from your homepage.</p>
          </a><br>
          <a name="week1"><br>
          <h4>Week 1: due 9/5</h4></a>
          <p><u>Do this first:</u><br>
            Write a â€˜programâ€™ using the English language which produces a composition via a set of instructions. Your instructions should be simple enough that they could be executed by any one of your classmates within in less than 10 min., with only a black sharpie, a tabloid sheet of white paper and no additional guidance. Your resulting composition should be something that you find interesting.<br>
            ðŸ‘‰ <i>Email me (changa2@newschool.edu) with your instructions by noon on September 5th.</i></p>
          <p><u>Part 2:</u><br>
            Read <a href="readings/Braitenberg1984.pdf" target="_blank">this excerpt</a> (itâ€™s only 9 pages) from the 1986 book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/vehicles" target="_blank">Vehicles</a> by Valentino Braitenburg. Does this change how you think about your composition instructions? Weâ€™ll discuss in class.</p>
          <p><u>Part 3:</u><br>
            Make a Github account if you donâ€™t already have one, and email me your @username.</p>
